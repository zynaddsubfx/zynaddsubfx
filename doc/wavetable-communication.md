# Wavetable communication

This explains how RT and non-RT threads communicate when new waves for the
wavetable need to be generated.

## Wavetable layout

A Tensor3 (3D-Tensor) has the following contents:

```
  ooooooo 1D-Tensor (frequeny values in Hz)      --
                                                  |
  ooooooo 1D-Tensor (semantic values, e.g.        | "wavetable scales"
                     random seeds or              |
                     basewave function params)   --

  ooooooo 1D-Tensor (float buffer = 1 wave)      --
  ^                                               |
  |                                               | "wavetable data"
  o...ooo 2D Tensor (Tensor1s for each freq)      | or just
  ^       with ringbuffer semantics (see below)   | "waves"
  |       (MW produces, AD note consumes)         |
  |                                               |
  o...ooo 3D Tensor (Tensor2s for each semantic) --

```

Ringbuffer layout:

```
  no required space holder (r=w is unambiguous internally)             wrap
         |                                                               |
         v               |--reserved for write--|                        v
  ...----|--can be read--|                      |--can be reserved next...
  ...oooooooo............oooo...................oooo......................
         |               |                      |
         r               w_delayed              w              <- pointers
```

Wavetable layout:

```
 o scales for ringbuffer (Tensor1, semantics + freqs)
 o ringbuffer (Tensor3, wave data)

 o timestamp of params for current ringbuffer
 o timestamp of params for next ("to be filled") ringbuffer

 o wavetable mode (e.g. random seeds, basefunc parameter, ...)
```

ADnote contains two wavetables per OscilGen:

- current wavetable (is used, can be refilled with new waves)
- next wavetable (under construction after parameter change)

## Asynchonicity principles

MiddleWare and ADnoteParams are run by 2 different threads at the same
time. This can cause issues, like outdated requests. To avoid this, the
following principles have been set up:

* wavetable requests induced by parameter changes always carry a timestamp
* any side should not rely on the other side handling the asynchronicity
  "well", i.e. it can not be relied on the other side detectig messages
  with outdated timestamps

## Sequence diagram

The following (not necessarily UML standard) diagram explains
how and when new wavetables are being generated. There are two
entry points, marked with an "X".

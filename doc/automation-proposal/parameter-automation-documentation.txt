An Introduction to a Revised MIDI Learn/Automation System Within ZynAddSubFX
============================================================================

Motivation
----------

One of the major issues expressed by users around the time of the initial
3.0.0 launch was that they were dissatisfied with automations when using
ZynAddSubFX within their preferred VST host. This was a combination of:

1. Hosts providing a poor workflow for sending MIDI CC events compared to VST
   parameters
2. Confusion with the use of MIDI learn within Zyn
3. Issues regarding saving/loading parameters exposed through MIDI learn 
4. Parameter resolution for MIDI CCs
5. Some parameters only produce updates on the next note

This feature attempts to address points 1, 2, & 3. Issue 4 is a large undertaking
but is expected to become complete for the 3.1.x release.  Issue 5 is being fixed 
one set of parameters at a time and should be addressed in the 3.0.x series.

Overview & Terminology
----------------------

The Macro System boils down to replacing the existing MIDI learn implementation
with a series of 'slots' for parameter automation and automation
macros. 

What is an automation?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A single parameter, e.g. the addsynth base frequency in part 1, kit 1
- A gain and offset to adjust the range of values the automation will reach 
(e.g. -50 cents to +150 cents)
- A mapping function (currently only linear, log, custom, etc coming soon)

What is a macro?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A group of automations that get assigned to an automation slot

All automations in the macro are operated together. Thus turning one knob on
your MIDI controller or a single automation lane in a DAW can change up to 4.footnote[see <<FAQ>>] parameters
at a time. Using the automation mappings allows for all the parameters to be adjusted 
in different amounts and/or directions, but they are all moved by actuating the macro.

Macros are assembled by adding automations to an automation slot.

What is an automation slot?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A set of one or more automations (a single macro)
- An optional MIDI CC binding or plugin host automation

There are global automation slots and instrument automation slots that can be saved 
and loaded independently.  The automation slots which are exposed to VST/LV2 plugin 
hosts are:

- Master Automation Slot 1..32
- Instrument 1..4 Automation Slot 1..4  

NOTE:Instrument 5..16 have the same slots, but they are *NOT*
exposed to LV2/VST hosts. They are only available for MIDI bindings.

All global automation slots (and some instrument slots) will always be exposed to VST/LV2 hosts.
This keeps the total number of parameters exposed to a host somewhat
reasonable: 48 slots for automation of up to 192 parameters.

At the level of a Zyn master file (.xmz) the automation slots
can be bound to MIDI CCs; loading the file will reload the midi bindings.

At the level of Zyn instrument files (.xiz) the automation slots can be saved
without a MIDI binding; loading the instrument will reload the instrument macros,
but the MIDI bindings (if any) will remain in the same instrument slots.

Zyn MIDI-learn files (.xlz) can store the MIDI CC+Channel linkage to all
automation (and macro) slots.

Automation Slots User Interface
-------------------------------

TODO: There are new buttons and stuff. Show me pictures

.. The automation view is made up of two sub-views [Master Automation], &
   [Part Automation]
.. The [Part Automation] sub-view can be navigated via setting the active part in the
   sidebar of zyn-fusion like other similar views
.. The automation view shows:
... MIDI binding if any e.g. "Chan 2, CC 14" (or "None" or "Learning...")
... Parameter path + name (see unfa's convention) (perhaps the OSC address
    via a hover over tooltip)
... Minimum value*
... Maximum value*
... Log/Linear switch*
... * => (optional until more floating point parameters are exposed)
... Possible display of the current value with a horizontal slider to
          control 


Workflow examples
-----------------

Automating a parameter in plugin mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. Use CTRL or click the [Learn] button to start learning an automation
. Click on one or more controls (knobs/sliders/buttons) to assign them to
  automation slots
.. After clicking, each control is allocated to the next free Master
   automation slot
.. the automation slot is put into the unbound state (it can be put into
   "MIDI learn" mode later.
. The automation can be adjusted in the automation view

Binding parameters to MIDI in standalone mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The workflow is streamlined for using a global automation slot:

. Use CTRL or click the [Learn] button to start learning an automation
. Click on one or more controls (knobs/sliders/buttons) to assign them to
  automation slots
.. After clicking, each control is allocated to the next free Master
   automation slot
.. Each automation slot is then placed into the "MIDI learn" mode, watching for
   the next unbound MIDI CC that arrives in standalone mode 
   (MIDI CCs are identified by Channel+CC# in Master automation slots)
. The user optionally sends CCs to be bound by wiggling the controls on their
  physical (or virtual) MIDI device
. The automation can be adjusted in the automation view

Learning a Macro Automation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. Use double tap CTRL or double click the [Learn] button to start learning
  an automation
. Repeat the automation learning process, but all new parameters will be
  applied to the same automation slot


Adjusting automation ranges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. Go to the [Automation] view
. If the automation slot is an instrument slot, the instrument subview can be selected
  with the numbers in the left column, just as when navigating between parts
. Find the right automation slot and automation
. Adjust gain
.. High gain will make the macro traverse the whole range of travel with just a little movement of the knob.
.. Low gain will make the macro travel less range than the knob in the UI
.. Negative gain makes the macro adjust the parameter down when the macro is turned up
. Adjust offset
.. This moves the macro's range of travel for the parameter up or down
. If an automation was unintentional the user can use a handle widget on
        the left side of the automation to delete it, or drag it to another
        slot

Learning/changing MIDI CC bindings after loading an instrument/binding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. Go to the [Automation] view
. Go to the [Master Automation] or [Part Automation] subview
. Find the right automation slot and automation
. Single click on the MIDI CC widget
.. The automation switches to the "learning CC" state
. Wiggle some MIDI controller
. OR Double click on the MIDI CC widget
.. this shows a dialog to manually choose the channel and CC id
. The CC has been remapped
. If binding is undesired a slot in learning state can be clicked on to
    disable learning a MIDI mapping (good option for VST/LV2 use)

How does this differ from the 3.0.0 workflow?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MIDI CC mapping cannot be remapped without learning and unlearning
currently.


Making Slight Changes to an Automation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It may make sense as an advanced functionality to allow changing what a
parameter has been bound to (e.g. voice 1 volume vs voice 3 volume) with a
dropdown.

FAQ
---
Q: Why only 4 automations to a slot?
A: Limiting it to only 4 allowed for an easier design in the UI. There is no
limitation in the software and if many users request more capability, we will
extend it to more. 

Q: What happens if a single parameter is in multiple automation slots?
A: Currently the engine will set the parameter to the value from the macro that
was most recently changed. Future versions may allow for macro fusion to combine
multiple values in different ways.

Q: Why didn't you add _feature X_
A: We love well documented feature requests. Please leave your idea in our bugtracker at https://sourceforge.net/p/zynaddsubfx/feature-requests/

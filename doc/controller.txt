Modulation wheel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The modulation wheel (MIDI CC #1) controls the amount of modulation applied
by the Amplitude, Frequency and Filter LFOs in all voices. The amount
of control is governed by the Modulation Wheel depth parameter. When this
parameter is set to 0, the modulation wheel has no control over the modulation
amount, and it is always the value set by the *Depth* setting in the
respective LFO. The default value for the Modulation Wheel depth parameter
is 80.

When the modulation depth parameter is advanced above 0, the modulation wheel
starts to influence the amount of modulation. When the modulation wheel
is it its center position (control value 64), the modulation amount will
always be at the value set by the *Depth* setting in LFO. Smaller modulation
wheel values than 64 will decrease the amount of modulation, and larger
modulation values will increase it, the amount of decrease or increase being
governed by the modulation depth parameter. The modulation amount does not
necessarily drop to zero just because the modulation wheel is at zero,
depending on the setting of the depth parameter. For the modulation amount
to drop to zero, the modulation wheel depth value must be 64 (half way
position) or more.

Note that in any case, when the modulation depth is set such that modulation
wheel does have control over the modulation amount, the maximum amount of
modulation applied (when the modulation wheel has a value of 127), will be
higher than the base setting in the LFO depth parameters.

When the *Exp Mwh* parameter is enabled, the modulation scale becomes
exponential. Pragmatically, this has two effects:

* The amount of modulation as the modulation wheel is advanced becomes more
  gradual, or put another way, the modulation wheel must be advanced further to
  get the same amount of modulation when the scale is exponential compared to
  when it is not. This gives more precise control over the onset of modulation.
* When the modulation wheel is advanced past its center position (value 64),
  the maximum attainable modulation amount is much higher.

Note that even when modulation scale is set to exponential, a center modulation
wheel value (64) still corresponds to the modulation depth set in the
respective LFOs.

So, to sum up:

* The Modulation Wheel depth parameter must be larger 0 for the modulation
  wheel to have any effect on the modulation amount.
* A center modulation wheel position (value 64) corresponds to the modulation
  depth setting in the LFOs.
* Decreasing the modulation wheel value towards 0 will reduce the amount of
  modulation, and advancing it towards the maximum value (127) will increase
  the amount of modulation, as governed by the Modulation Wheel depth
  parameter, with the amount of modulation set by the LFO depth parameters
  as the base.
* For a modulation wheel value of 0 to completely inhibit any modulation,
  the Modulation Wheel depth control must be 64 (half way) or higher.
* Enabling Exponential Modulation Wheel will provide finer control of
  the onset of modulation, as well as higher achievable maximum modulation
  values.

Portamento
~~~~~~~~~~

* *Prt.Rcv*: If the part receives portamento On/Off (65) controller
* *Enable*: If portamento is enabled for the part
* *Auto*: If portamento is applied only when playing legato
* *Time*: The duration of the portamento
* *Up/down*: Sets ratio of portamento time between up- and down-going pitch
steps
* *Tr.type*: The threshold type.
Checked means that the portamento activates when the difference of frequencies
is above the threshold ("Thresh"); not checked is for below the threshold.
* *Thresh*: The threshold of the portamento.
It represents the minimum or the maximum number of halftones
(or hundred cents) required to start the portamento. 
The difference is computed between the last note and current note.

NOTE: The threshold refers to the frequencies and not to MIDI notes
      (you should consider this if you use microtonal scales).

Proportional Portamento

* *Prop.*: If the portamento time is proportional to ratio of frequencies
* *Prp. Scale*: Ratio needed to double the time of portamento
* *Prp. Depth*: The divergence from constant portamento time

Detailed portamento description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The basis for the portamento function is the corresponding function in a
monophonic analog synthesizer.  In an analog synthesizer, portamento is
implemented as a lag circuit on the CV from the keyboard to the oscillators,
providing a smooth glide of the pitch rather than jumping to the new pitch when
a new note is played.  Thus, a key feature of portamento is that whenever a new
note is played, regardless of whether the target pitch of the previous note had
been reached or not, the journey to the new pitch starts at whatever pitch
prevailed at the time.

In a polyphonic analog synthesizer, a trivial implementation of portamento is
using separate lag circuits at the keyboard CV inputs of each voice. This does
create a bit of a chaotic portamento behavior however, because the glide for a
played voice will start at whatever pitch the individual voice had previously,
which is not necessarily the same as the previously played note, as it would be
in the case of monophonic portamento. Nevertheless, this is the most common
implementation of portamento on a polyphonic analog synthesizer, and the mild
chaos that ensues when portamento is enabled is still musically useful.

Many analog synthesizers implement an optional so-called auto mode for the
portamento, whereby portamento is only applied when notes are played
legato (i.e. one one key is pressed without releasing the previously played
key). This way, the player has direct control over the application of
portamento directly in the playing style, without having to resort to a
separate controller (button or pedal) to enable/disable portamento.

In a digital synthesizer, it is possible to emulate the behavior of an analog
polyphonic synthesizer, especially if the implementation models the behavior
in terms of a fixed set of voices which are allocated much in the same way as
the analog voices would be. However, in synthesizers such as ZynAddSubFx,
voices are allocated on an as-needed basis, and deallocated afterwards, so when
triggering a new voice, it has no "previous pitch". Unless we purposely want to
emulate the behavior of a voice allocated analog synthesizer, we can explore
other portamento models.

Indeed, in a digital synthesizer, it is possible to use the monophonic
portamento behavior as the basis also for polyphonic portamento. This means
that when triggering a new note, the pitch of the note should start at the
pitch of the previously played note, which may not actually be the target pitch
of that note if there was an ongoing portamento at the time the new note was
triggered.

For example, assume C1 is played, and then C2. C2 starts its pitch at C1 and
glides upwards. Half way, say when the to-be-C2 voice has reached G1 during its
glide, C3 is played. The portamento for C3 should then start at G1, i.e. the
pitch that the second played note had reached at that time, rather than for
instance at the target pitch of C2, which would give the impression of a C2
suddenly being played from nowhere, before gliding up to C3. This mimics the
smooth new-notes-start-at-the-current-pitch behavior of a monophonic
portamento implementation, which is both logical and consistent.

Portamento operation in ZynAddSubFx
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For each note played, the portamento controller makes a decision as to whether
the note should have portamento or not, governed by the *Auto*, *Enable*,
*Tr.Type* and *Thresh* parameters. Whenever a note is played which should have
portamento, the portamento starts at the pitch that the previously played note
was at when the new note was played. This slightly long-winded explanation
encompasses the case of the previous note being in the process of gliding due
to portamento, in which case the new note should start precisely at that pitch.
This behavior is the same in all key assignment modes (polyphonic, monophonic
or legato).

In poly mode, each note will have its own portamento, i.e. each note will glide
individually from its initial pitch (see previous section) to the target pitch
(= the note played).

Regardless of the key assign mode, portamento can be enabled for every note, or
only when notes are played legato. This is governed by the *Auto* parameter.
This parameter is enabled by default. When loading patches created prior to
Zynaddsubfx version 3.0.7, the *Auto* parameter is set according to the key
assign mode: Auto is disabled in poly mode, and enabled in mono and legato
modes.

Effects
-------

Effects are, generally, blackboxes that transform audio signals in a
specified way. More exactly, the only input data for an effect in ZynAddSubFX
is:

* an array of samples, which is read *on line*
* the current system time (used for LFOs)

The output is the transformed array of samples.

NOTE: As described, effects have no information about anything else. For
example, key presses are not recognized. Therefore, pressing a key does not
initiate the LFO. Phase nobs will always be relative to a *global* LFO, which is
only dependent on the system time.

ZynAddSubFX has 3 types of effects:

* System Effects
* Insertion Effects
* Instrument Effects

TODO: Describe these 3 types.

General topics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* *Wetness* determines the mix of the results of the effect and its input. This
mix is made the effects output. If an effect is wet, it means that nothing of
the input signal is bypassing the effect. If it is dry, then the effect has no
effect.
* *Filter stages* are the number of times that this filter is applied in series.
So, if this number is 1, you simply have this one filter. If it is two, the
sound first passes the filter, and the results then pass the same filter again.
In ZynAddSubFX, the wetness is applied after all stages were passed.

TODO: Can you make a diagram for these two, please?

Equalizer
~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

An equalizer is a filter effect that applies different volume to
different frequencies of the input signal. This can, for example, to "filter
out" unwanted frequencies.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_%28signal_processing%29[Wikipedia] has some
information about filters. Also, most of ZynAddSubFX's implementations follow
the http://www.musicdsp.org/files/Audio-EQ-Cookbook.txt["Cookbook formulae for
audio EQ"] by Robert Bristow-Johnson.

Filter Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are different types of filters. The number of poles define what will
happen at a given frequency. Mathematically, the filters are functions which
have poles at that frequency. Usually, two poles mean that the function has more
"steepness", and that you can set the exact value of the function at the poles
by defining the "resonance value". Filters with two poles are also often
referenced as http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterworth-Filter[Butterworth
Filters].

********************************************************************
For the interested, functions having poles means that we are given a quotient of
polynomials. The denominator has degree 1 or 2, depending on the filter having
one or two poles. In the file _DSP/AnalogFilter.cpp_,
_AnalogFilter::computefiltercoefs()_ sets the coefficients (depending on the
filter type), and _AnalogFilter::singlefilterout()_ shows the whole polynomial
(in a formula where no quotient is needed).
********************************************************************

The term passband (or often just "band") refers to the amount of frequencies
which are not (or sometimes "not much") attenuated by the filter. 

There are different types of filters:

* Low-Pass Filters - they let pass only the frequencies lower than the cutoff
frequency
* High-Pass Filters - they let pass only the frequencies higher than the cutoff
frequency
* Low Shelf and High shelf filters are special types of LP and HP with less
passband.
* Band-Pass Filters - they let pass only the frequencies close to the cutoff
frequency
* Peak Filters are Band-Pass Filters with only a small amount of frequencies
("a peak") being passed
* Band-Reject Filters - they let pass only frequencies not close to the cutoff
frequency
* Notch Filters are Band-Reject Filters with only a small amount of frequencies
("a notch") being rejected

You can what ZynAddSubFX's filters do in the graphical window. The following
explains the abbreviations.

* LPF 1: Low-Pass, 1 pole.
* LPF 2: Low-Pass, 2 poles.
* HPF 1: High-Pass, 1 pole.
* HPF 2: High-Pass, 2 poles.
* BPF 2: Band-Pass, 2 poles.
* NF 2: Notch, 2 poles.
* PK 2: Peak, 2 poles.
* LS 2 Low Shelf, 2 poles.
* HS 2 High Shelf, 2 poles.

Filter GUI
^^^^^^^^^^

We describe all parts of the GUI here.

* The gain defines an offset which is added to the complete filter.
* The graphical window shows you the resulting filter type. This can be very
helpful to understand how the filters work.
* *B.* lets you choose the passband number. Multiple passbands define one
filter. This is important if you want multiple filters to be called after each
other. Note that filters are commutative.
* *T.* lets you choose the current filter's type, as described above.
* *Freq* describes the frequencies where the filter has its poles. For some
filters, this is called the "cutoff" frequency. Note, however, that a bandpass
filter has two cutoff frequencies.
* *Gain* is only active for some filters and sets the amount of a special peak
these filters have. Note that for those filters, using the predefined gain makes
them effectless.
* *Resonance* lets you describe a peak at the given frequency for filters with
2 poles. This can be compared to real physical objects that have more gain at
their resonance frequency.
* *St.* lets you define multiple filter stages. This is equivalent to having
multiple bands of the same filter.

Chorus
~~~~~~

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a chorus, there are many people. Even if each of them sings at exactly
the same frequency, all their voices usually sound different. We say the have a
different timbre. Timbre is the way we perceive sound and makes us differ
between different music instruments. This is, physically, achieved by varying
both the amplitude envelope and the frequency spectrum. Multiple sounds with
slightly different timbre make a sound more shimmering, or powerful. This is the
chorus effect.

The chorus effect can be achieved by multiple people singing together. In
a concert, there are many instruments, resulting in the same effect. When making
electronic music, we only have an input wave and have to generate these
different timbres by ourselves. ZynAddSubFx therefore simply plays the sound,
pitch modulated by an LFO, and adds this to the original sound. This explains
the diagram below: The multiple pitches are generated by a delayed version of
the input. This version is being pitched by an LFO. More detailled, this pitch
is generated by varying the reading speed of the delayed sound by an LFO.

Related effects to Chorus are Flangers.


Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

We explain the functionality in a diagram and list the components below.

* First, crossover is applied. The *LR Mix* knob lets you set the amount. If
you set it to 0.0, you will always have a stereo input.
* The following 4 knobs control the LFO.
** *Freq* determines the LFO's frequency
** *Rnd* determines the LFO amplitude's randomness
** *LFO Type* lets you choose the type of LFO
** *St.df* lets you determine how much left and right LFO are phase shifted.
64.0f means stereo, higher values increase the right lfo relatively to the left
one.
* *Delay* is the time that the delayed sound is delayed "on average". Note that
the delay also depends a bit on the current pitch.
* After the correct element of the sound buffer is found using the LFO, the
feedback let
* Next, the singal can be negated, If the *Neg* Checkbox is activated,
the amplitude is multiplied by -1.
* Finally, *Panning* is applied. Set it to 0.0 to only hear output on the right
side.

Distort
~~~~~~~

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Distortion means, in general, altering a signal. Natural instruments
usually produce sine like waves. A wave is transformed in an unnatural way when
distortion is used. The most distorted waves are pulse waves. It is typical for
distortion to add overtones to a sound. Distortion often increases the power and
the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness[loudness] of a signal, while the db
level is not increased.

Distortion can happen in many situations when working with audio. Often, this is
not wanted. In classical music, for example, distortion does not occur
naturally. However, distortion can also be a wanted effect. It is typical for
Rock guitars, but also present in electronic music, mostly in Dubstep and
DrumNBass. Distortion is an important topic in the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war[Loudness War].

NOTE: As distortion increases loudness, distorted music can cause ear damage
at lower volume levels. Thus, you might want to use it a bit careful.

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

We explain the functionality in a diagram and list the components below.

image::./gen/distort.png[width="700"]

* Negation is the first thing to happen. If the *Neg* Checkbox is activated, the
amplitude is multiplied by -1.
* Panning is applied. Note, however, that you have to activate the
Stereo Checkbox, labeled *St*, before.
* Pre amplification is done next. The amount can be changed using the
*Drive* nob. Indeed, this is the amount of distortion. For example, if you clip
a signal, the louder the input gets, the more distortion you will get. This can
have different meanings for different types of distortion, as described below.
* Before applying the waveshape, or afterwards, you can apply Highpass
and Lowpass filters. The type is HPF2 or LPF2, meaning butterworth lowpasses.
They are labeled *HPF* and *LPF*. Whether this is done before, or after the
waveshape, depends on the checkbox labeled *PF*.
* The next step is the wave shape. This defines how the wave is
actuallymodified. The *Type* ComboBox lets you define how. We will discuss some
types below.
* After the wave shape, we scale the level again. This is called
output amplification. You can change the value using the *Level* knob.
* Crossover is the last step. This is controlled by the knob *LR Mix* and
means that afterwards, a percentage of the left side is applied to the right
side, and, synchronously, the other way round. It is a kind of interpolation
between left and right. If you set the LR Mix to 0.0, you will always have a
stereo output.

********************************************************************
One practical reason for using filters afterwards is that distortion can lead to
waves with undesired high frequency parts. Those can be filtered out using the
HPF.
A reason for using filters before applying is to achieve multiband
distortion. ZynAddSubFX has no "real" multiband distortion by now, however.
********************************************************************

For a few types of distortion we will make a description below. Please note that
you can get a very good impression for this using the *Wsh* ComboBox in the
Oscillator editor.

Atan & Sigmoid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the default setting. It is an easy way to apply loudness to a
wave without getting undesired effects. Thus, it can be used both for making
instruments that sound like "real" ones, but also for electronic music. The
transformation turns, roughly said, every amplitude into a square amplitude.
Thus, sine, power, pulse and triangle turn into a usual square wave, while a saw
turns into a phased square wave. A chirp wave turns into a kind of phase
modulated square wave.

Quants
^^^^^^

Quantization can be seen as an unnatural effect, which is often used
for electronic music. The transformation is a bit similar to building the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum[lower sum] of a wave, mathematically
said. This means that the transformation effect turns your "endless high"
sampled wave into only a few samples. For more information, read
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_%28sound_processing%29[Wikipedia's
article].

The more distortion you will apply, the less samples will be used. Indeed,
this is equivalent to say that more input amplification is used. To see this,
here is a small sample of code, where "ws" is the (correctly scaled amount of
input amplification, and "n" the number of original samples.

---------------------------------
for(i = 0; i < n; ++i)
  smps[i] = floor(smps[i] / ws + 0.5f) * ws;
---------------------------------

********************************************************************
This kind of distortion might remind you of gaming console sound. Let's say
we have a computer which is not able to play sounds with many samples.
Therefore, it can only play sounds with a low sample rate. This leads to exactly
this effect.
********************************************************************

NOTE: If you turn on quantisation very high, you might be confused
that, especially high notes, make no sound. The reason is simple: High
frequencies are "forgotten" if you sample with only few samples. Also, the sign
of an amplitude can be forgotten. This behaviour might make some quantisations a
bit unexpected.


Limiting & Clipping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Limiting usually means that for a signal, the amplitude is modified because
it exceeds its maximum value. Overdrive, as often used for guitars, is often
achieved by limiting: It happens because an amplifier "overdrives" the maximum
amplitude it can deliver. For more general information, you can try
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting[Wikipedia].

ZynAddSubFX has two types of limiting. Soft limiting, here as *Lmt*, means
that the sound may not exceed a certain value. If the amplitude does so, it will
simply be reduced to the limiting value. Hard limiting, is also called clipping
and abbreviated *Clip*. This means that if the maximum is exceeded, instead of
being constant at the limiting value, the original signal still has some
influence on the output signal. Still, it does not exceed the limiting value.
For ZynAddSubFX, a signal exceeding the limiting value will continue to grow "in
the negative".

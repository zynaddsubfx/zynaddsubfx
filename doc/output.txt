Output engines
--------------

There are different output engines for zynaddsubfx.

ALSA
~~~~
Simply start zyn using `zynaddsubfx -O alsa`.

NOTE: If your system is using PulseAudio, this may not work. Even if it does,
and ALSA redirects to PulseAudio, realtime guarantees can not be made. It is
recommended to follow the steps in the <<PulseAudio>> section.

NOTE: If your system is using PulseAudio, this is the suggested way, but may
not work out of the box, or it may not do what you want. Please seee the
<<PulseAudio>> section.

There are different ways to forward zyn to jack:

* Automatic connecting with `zynaddsfubx -O jack -a` will usually do what you
  want
* Manual selective connecting can be done by using `zynaddsfubx -O jack` and
  then using one of
  - the `qjackctl` gui
  - the `jack_connect` commandline utility
* Automatic selective connecting can be done using

PulseAudio
~~~~~~~~~~
PulseAudio is *not* **directly** implemented in zyn. While PulseAudio can be
really practical in many cases, it has no realtime guarantees. Running zyn
right through pulse is thus not intended. In case you want to keep
PulseAudio and still use zyn, the suggested way is to route PulseAudio through
jack. You need to

* Install jack2
* Route pulse through jack2 using cadence
  
These steps should be described for your distribution. Check out one of the
following links.

After that, follow the usual steps described under <<Jack>>.

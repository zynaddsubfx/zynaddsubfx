NRPN (Non Registered Parameters Number)
---------------------------------------

NRPNs can control all system and insertion effect parameters.
For example, you may change the reverb time when playing to keyboard or
flanger's lfo frequency.
You can disable the NRPN receiving by deselecting the "NRPN" checkbox from the
main window (near "Master Keyshift" counter).
The controls for system effects can be sent on any midi channel 
The controls for insertion effects on channel 0 are for system insertion effects 
the controls on channels 1 .. 15 are for the corresponding part insertion effects

The parameters are:

- NRPN coarse (99 or 0x63)sets the system/insertion effects (4 for system effects or 8 for insertion effects)
- NRPN fine (98 or 0x62)sets the number of the effect (first effect is 0)
- Data entry coarse (6) sets the parameter number of effect to change(see below)
- Data entry fine (26) sets the parameter of the effect

You have to send NRPN coarse/fine before sending Data entry coarse/fine.
If the effect/parameter doesn't exists or is set to none, then the NRPN is
ignored.

Example(all values in this example are hex):

    B0 63 08 // Select the insertion effects
    B0 62 01 // Select the second effect (remember: the first is 00 and not 01)
    B0 06 00 // Select the effect parameter 00
    B0 26 7F // Change the parameter of effect to the value 7F (127)

WARNING: Changing of some of the effect parameters produces clicks when sounds
passes thru these effects.
I advise you to change only when the sound volume that passes thru the effect to be very low (or silence).
Some parameters produce clicks when are changed very fast.

Here are the effects parameter number (for Data entry coarse).
The parameters that produces clicks are written in [red]#red# and have (AC)
after their entry (always clicks).
The parameter that produces clicks only when they are changed fast are written
in [orange]#orange# and have a (FC) after the entry (Fast Clicks).
Most parameters has the range from 0 to 127.
When parameters have another range, it is written as [low...high] .

EQ
~~

[verse]
+[orange]#00 - Gain (FC)#+

All other settings of the EQ are shown in a different way.
The N represent the band ("B." setting in the UI) and the first band is 0
(and not 1), like it is shown in the UI.
Change the "N" with the band you like.
If you want to change a band that doesn't exist, the NRPN will be ignored.

+[red]#10+N*5 - Change the mode of the filter [0..9] (AC)#
11+N*5 - Band's filter frequency
12+N*5 - Band's filter gain
13+N*5 - Band's filter Q (bandwidth or resonance)
[grey]#14+N*5 - reserved#+

Example of setting the gain on the second band:

. The bands start counting from  0, so the second band is 1 => N=1.
.  The formula is 12+N*5 => 12+1*5=17, so the number of effect parameter
.  (for Data entry coarse) is 17.

ZynAddSubFX offers several different types of filters, which can be used to
shape the spectrum of a signal.
The primary parameters that affect the characteristics of the filter are the
cutoff, resonance, filter stages, and the filter type.

* *Cutoff*: This value determines which frequency marks the changing point for
            the filter. In a low pass filter, this value marks the point where
            higher frequencies are attenuated.
* *Resonance*: The resonance of a filter determines how much excess energy is
               present at the cutoff frequency. In ZynAddSubFX, this is
               represented by the Q-factor, which is defined to be the cutoff
               frequency divided by the bandwidth. In other words higher Q
               values result in a much more narrow resonant spike.
* *Stages*: The number of stages in a given filter describes how sharply it is
            able to make changes in the frequency response.

The basic 'analog' filters that ZynAddSubFX offers are shown below, with the
center frequency being marked by the red line.
The 'state variable' filters should look quite similar.
For more warmth and to serve the hype there is also a 'moog', that does the 
same as 'analog' but with a special character.

As previously mentioned, the Q value of a filter affects how concentrated the
signal's energy is at the cutoff frequency; The result of differing Q values are
below.

TIP: For many classical analog sounds, high Q values were used on sweeping
filters. A simple high Q low pass filter modulated by a strong envelope is
usually sufficient to get a good sound.

Lastly, the affect of the order of the filter can be seen below.
This is roughly synonymous with the number of stages of the filter.
For more complex patches it is important to realize that the extra sharpness in
the filter does not come for free as it requires many more calculations being
performed; This phenomena is the most visible in subsynth, where it is easy to
need several hundred filter stages to produce a given note.

There are different types of filters. The number of poles define what will
happen at a given frequency. Mathematically, the filters are functions which
have poles that correspond to that frequency. Usually, two poles mean that the
function has more "steepness", and that you can set the exact value of the
function at the poles by defining the "resonance value". Filters with two poles
are also often referenced
as https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterworth-Filter[Butterworth Filters].

********************************************************************
For the interested, functions having poles means that we are given a quotient of
polynomials. The denominator has degree 1 or 2, depending on the filter having
one or two poles. In the file _DSP/AnalogFilter.cpp_,
_AnalogFilter::computefiltercoefs()_ sets the coefficients (depending on the
filter type), and _AnalogFilter::singlefilterout()_ shows the whole polynomial
(in a formula where no quotient is needed).
********************************************************************

A special class of filter is the COMB Filter. It creates a spectrum with regular 
spaced notches like a comb. It can 'simulate' the effect of the reflections
of a surface next to a microphone using the type FWD. Or it can 'simulate' reflections
that are created at the end of a string using type BWD or BOTH together.
In the BWD setting with high Q setting the comb filter can self oscillate.
Excited with a transient noise it can produce string like sounds.

TIP: When using it in a voice make sure the Envelope doesn't sustain at 0 to prevent 
the voice being killed while the filter is still making nice sounds.

* *C.freq*: Cutoff frequency
* *Q*: Level of resonance for the filter
* *V.SnsA.*: Velocity sensing amount for filter cutoff
* *V.Sns.*: Velocity sensing function
* *freq.tr*: Frequency tracking amount. When this parameter is positive, higher
             note frequencies shift the filter's cutoff frequency higher.
* *gain*: Additional gain/attenuation for filter
* *St*: Filter stages

NOTE: TODO add a lengthy section on the formant filter setup

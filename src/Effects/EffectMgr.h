         * Therefore, parameters are loaded to this array which can then be used
         * to construct the full effect (via init()) once the object is in the
         * realtime context.
         *
         * Additionally this structure is used in the case of pasting effects as
         * pasted effect object are *not* fully initialized when they're put on
         * the middleware -> backend ringbuffer, but settings has the values
         * loaded from the XML serialization.
         * The settings values can be pasted once they're on the realtime thread
         * and then they can be applied.
         *
         * The requirement that the realtime memory pool is used to create the
         * effect is in place as it is possible to change the effect type in the
         * realtime thread and thus the new effect would draw from the realtime
         * memory pool and the old object would be expected to be freed to the
         * realtime memory pool.
